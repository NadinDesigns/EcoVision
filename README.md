## About the project

This website was created as part of my learning journey and a practice exercise with SASS.  
It is dedicated to promoting eco-friendly initiatives and sustainable lifestyles.

The project features interactive elements like card flipping, animated transitions, and a responsive hamburger menu.  
The goal was to explore modern layout and styling techniques while delivering a meaningful message.
